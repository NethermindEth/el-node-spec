# EigenLayer Middleware API 

The EigenLayer Middleware API provides monitoring and common metrics for middleware services designed for the EigenLayer protocol.

## Base URL

The base URL for the API is:

```
/eigen
```

## API Versioning

This document describes the API version 1.0.0.

The API versioning can be described using one of the following four approaches:

### Version in the path

The API version is included in the URL path as follows:

```
/eigen/v1
```

#### Pros

- Clear versioning for clients: Including the version in the path makes it immediately clear to clients which version of the API they are using.
- Easy to implement: Most HTTP frameworks provide easy ways to extract the version from the path.
- Caching: Versioning in the path makes caching easier, since different versions of the API can be cached separately.

#### Cons

- Path pollution: Including the version in the path can make the path longer and more difficult to read.
- Inflexible: Once a version is released and endpoints are created with that version, it's difficult to make changes to that version without breaking clients.
- Client implementation: Clients need to be aware of the versioning scheme used in the path and update their URLs accordingly.

### Version in the query string

The API version is included in the query string as follows:

```
/eigen/endpoint?version=1.0.0
```

#### Pros

- Clean URLs: Including the version in a query parameter keeps the URLs cleaner and easier to read than including it in the path.
- Easy to implement: Most HTTP frameworks provide easy ways to extract query parameters.
- Flexibility: You can change the version without changing the path or breaking clients.
- Caching: Different versions of the API can be cached separately.

#### Cons

- Potential abuse: Users could potentially abuse the query parameter by including unexpected values.
- Complexity: The query parameter needs to be parsed from the request, which adds complexity to the implementation.
- Client implementation: Clients need to be aware of the versioning scheme used in the query string and update their URLs accordingly.

### Version in the request header

The API version is included in the request header as follows:

```http
GET /eigen/endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
X-API-Version: 1.0.0
```

#### Pros

- Cleaner URLs: Without the version in the path, URLs are shorter and easier to read.
- No need for client changes: Clients don't need to change their URLs when a new version is released.
- Easy to implement: Most HTTP frameworks provide easy ways to set and read custom headers.
- Separation of concerns: Versioning is separated from the request, which can be useful in some cases.

#### Cons

- Ambiguity: Clients need to inspect the response to determine which version of the API is being used.
- Complexity: Extracting the version from the headers requires additional parsing logic.
- Limited caching: Caching mechanisms may not be able to differentiate between different versions of the API if they're not included in the path.
- Header Stripping: Some HTTP clients may strip out unknown headers for security reasons

### Version in the request body

The API version is included in the request body as follows:

```http
GET /eigen/endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

#### Pros

- Flexibility: The version can be changed without affecting the path or breaking clients.
- Cleaner URLs: Without the version in the path, URLs are shorter and easier to read.
- No need for client changes: Clients don't need to change their URLs when a new version is released.

#### Cons

- Ambiguity: Clients need to inspect the response to determine which version of the API is being used.
- Complexity: Extracting the version from the response requires additional parsing logic.
- Caching: Different versions of the API can't be cached separately.

## Middleware

Endpoints to query middleware related information.

### GET /eigen/middleware/version
