A Middleware setup wizard tool would deploy the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) instance as part of the [Monitoring Stack](/docs/monitoring/intro) to collect metrics from the host machine and Middleware services. Initially, the only target would be the [Node Exporter](/docs/monitoring/node-exporter), but Middleware targets could be added dynamically by the tool when a new Middleware is deployed.
