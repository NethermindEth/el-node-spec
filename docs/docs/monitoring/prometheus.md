A Middleware setup wizard tool would deploy the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) instance as part of the [Monitoring Stack](/docs/monitoring/intro) to collect metrics from the host machine and middleware services. Initially, the only target would be the [Node Exporter](/docs/monitoring/node-exporter), but middleware targets could be added dynamically by the CLI tool when a new middleware is deployed.
