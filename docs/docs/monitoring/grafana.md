[Grafana Dashboards](https://grafana.com/) is an open source solution for metrics visualization. In this case, Grafana is used to visualize metrics collected by the [Prometheus](/docs/monitoring/prometheus) instance from all the middlewares and the host machine.

The [Middleware setup wizard tool](../wizard/intro) would deploy the Grafana instance with a set of initial resources. Each resource would have a unique `uid`. The `uid` is used to generate a unique URL for each resource, and it is unique across all resources in the Grafana instance. Be aware that the `uid` is not the same as the `id` property, which is auto-generated by Grafana. Also, some `uid` values would be reserved for the tool, and they couldn't be used for any other resource in the Grafana instance. Initial resources would be the [Eigen Layer folder](#eigen-layer-folder) and the [Host Metrics](#host-metrics) dashboard. Read more about them below.

## Eigen Layer folder

The Middleware setup wizard tool creates the Eigen Layer folder in Grafana. This folder is used to store all the dashboards for monitoring, both host and middlewares.

## Dashboards

Initially, the Middleware setup wizard tool would only deploy the [Host Metrics](#host-metrics) dashboard in the [Eigen Layer folder](#eigen-layer-folder). This dashboard monitors host resources like CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.

The Middleware specific dashboards are provided by Middleware developers in the installation package. The tool would deploy them dynamically in the [Eigen Layer folder](#eigen-layer-folder) when a new AVS is deployed.

### Host Metrics

The Host Metrics dashboard show all the basic metrics of the host machine. This dashboard is very common in the Grafana community to monitor Linux hosts resources. This dashboard is built using the [Node Exporter](/docs/monitoring/node-exporter) metrics.

:::note
The `el-host-metrics` is a reserved `uid` for the **Host Metrics** dashboard and couldn't be used for any other dashboard in the Grafana instance.
