The plugin system provides a way to extend the CLI tool with new functionalities that are not included by default. This is necessary due to the diversity of services and structure that a middleware could have. Each middleware could provide a plugin to extend the CLI tool with middleware-specific functionalities interacting with the services declared in the docker-compose setup.

## Plugin as a Docker image

A plugin is a Docker container created from a Docker image provided in the middleware package. The image could be provided following these two options:

1. Pre-built image
2. Built from a Dockerfile using a Git repository URL

## Proposal for the manifest and profile files

The plugin is defined in the manifest file and could be overwritten in the profile file if needed. To declare a plugin add this section at the root of the manifest/profile file:

```yaml
plugin: <plugin>
```

### <plugin\>

```yaml
# Pre-built image name ready to be pulled.
image: <string>

# URL to a Git repository to build the image from the source.
git: <string>
```

:::warning
The `image` has more priority than the `git` option. If both are provided, the `image` will be used.
:::

## Running the plugin

```bash
tool plugin [--middleware [middleware-name]] [plugin-name] [args...]
```

When the user runs the plugin, a container is created using the plugin image, and all the arguments specified by the user in the command are appended to the container [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint). The CLI runs the container plugin instance and waits until it finishes, showing the logs of the container. The exit code of the `cli plugin` command is the same exit code of the container plugin and will be printed in stdout to end-user knowledge.

The `--middleware` flag could be used to specify middleware target. If not specified, the default middleware will be used. Is useful when the user has multiple profiles of the same middleware.

## Accessing the middleware services

The plugin container will be executed in the same docker-compose network as the middleware instance. This means that the plugin container will be able to access the middleware services, and it can use the Docker name resolution to access the services using the names of the services defined in the docker-compose file. It is responsibility of the middlewares to use proper services names and include all the necessary functionalities in the docker-compose file to allow the plugin to do all the actions properly.
