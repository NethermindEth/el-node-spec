# Packaging procedure

Nodes in the EigenLayer Protocol under the proposed specification comprise of Docker containers running alongside backing services such as databases, indexers, and utility services. Developers are responsible for defining these services and their options well to work correctly. The objective is to create a standard interface to manage the setup, configuration, and updates of these Nodes.

The package for a specific version of a Node will consist of a **`docker-compose.yml`** file, a manifest file defining the package version and additional information (if the upgrade is optional or recommended, etc), and a set of profiles or different configurations for the package. 

Developers will publish their packages following the format defined [below](#node-package) in a git repository (Tap), which involves developers initializing a git repository with the required and standard structure that will be defined later. The [AVS setup wizard](/docs/category/avs-setup-wizard) would rely on this structure to get package information and install the Node.

The Tap can be within the AVS source code repository or in a separate repository. [We recommend the latter](/docs/spec/packaging/guidelines#create-a-separate-repository-for-the-avs-package).

Developers manage these repositories, and with each new release, they update the tap with the corresponding configuration files. The new package will only be considered correct if it follows the required structure and if a git tag that represents proper [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) is created with it in the tap repository.

The EigenLayer organization will maintain a core git repository that will serve as an index for all the published Nodes containing the URLs of all the packaging repositories. Developers have to create a Pull Request to this core repository to register their Node.

As an **alternative to centralized git hosting**, we suggest using distributed ledger technology (DLT), such as a blockchain, to store and manage Nodes configuration files and metadata. Developers would submit their configuration files, updates, and other relevant information to the DLT network.

This approach would require Developers to interact with the DLT network, submitting transactions and querying data. As a result, the management process becomes decentralized and transparent.

Decentralized git hosting such as [Gitopia](https://gitopia.com) can be used as an alternative to Github.

:::caution

While this decentralized approach is interesting and offers some unique benefits, it may not be the most practical solution for managing Nodes due to the added complexity and potential performance issues. However, it's worth considering as an alternative to more traditional centralized or repository-based approaches.

:::caution

The EigenLayer AVS Specification is designed for **Linux** systems. The packaging structure and its functionality rely on the use of Docker and Docker Networking, including host networking, which needs to be better supported on Windows and Mac OS.

## Node package

A Node is a collection of Docker services declared in a Docker Compose file. Developers are responsible for defining these services and their options well to work correctly.

The objective of a Node package is to provide all the necessary files to set up a Node in an on-premise setup using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) as a service manager.

### Package source

- Git repository

### Structure

A package is a set of profiles, which means each Node version could have a collection of profiles inside that the user could select at setup time, like the following:

```
eigenlayer install some/avs -v v1.0.0 [profile] [options...]
```

:::note

<NotCLIDisclaimer/>

:::

Profiles are suitable for creating specialized setups of the same version for different scenarios like different networks.

The `manifest.yml` file at the project's root is the entry point to define the project's structure, with information about the package and the list of profiles.

```
./
├── profile1/
│   ├── .env
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── profile.yml
├── profile2/
│   ├── .env
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── profile.yml
└── manifest.yml
```

### Profile

```
./
├── .env
├── docker-compose.yml
└── profile.yml
```

`.env` contains a list of environment variables used in the Docker Compose file. To know more about environment variables substitution in a Docker Compose file follow [this link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/#substitute-with-an-env-file).

`docker-compose.yml` is a standard Docker Compose file declaring all the services, volumes, networks, etc. required for the Node setup.

`profile.yml` is the file that contains options to configure the profile.

## Tap structure

The Tap should contain a `README.md`, and a `pkg` folder with the contents described [above](#structure). Optionally, a `checksum.txt` file can be provided. The following directory structure can be used as reference:

```
./
├── pkg/
│   ├── mainnet/
│   │   ├── .env
│   │   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   │   └── profile.yml
│   ├── goerli/
│   │   ├── .env
│   │   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   │   └── profile.yml
│   └── manifest.yml
├── checksum.txt
└── README.md
```

### Checksum

Calculating a checksum of the package is important to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data being transferred or stored. A checksum is a value calculated from the content of the package, and can be used to verify that the package has not been altered or corrupted. 

:::note

Providing a checksum is **optional**, but it's highly recommended to ensure the integrity of the package.

:::

:::caution

The package's checksum **MUST** be calculated using the **SHA-256** hashing algorithm. 

:::

The following script can be used to calculate the package checksum and generate the required `checksum.txt`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="unix" label="Linux/Unix/macOS" default>

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash

  # Check if a package root argument is provided
  if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <package_root>"
    exit 1
  fi

  # Set the package root directory and the output file
  package_root="$1"
  output_file="checksum.txt"

  # Remove the output file if it exists
  rm -f "$output_file"

  # Iterate through all files in the package, calculate their SHA-256 checksum, and save the result to the output file
  find "$package_root" -type f -not -path "*/.git/*" -exec sha256sum {} \; | sort -k 2 > "$output_file"

  # Print the final checksum of the output file
  sha256sum "$output_file"
  ```

  Save this script as `calculate_checksum.sh` in any directory, give it executable permissions with `chmod +x calculate_checksum.sh`, and run it with `./calculate_checksum.sh /path/to/package_root` providing the package root directory path as an argument. The output will be a file called `checksum.txt` containing the checksums of all files within the package, sorted by file path. The final checksum of the `checksum.txt` file will be printed to the console.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

  ```shell
  # Set the package root directory and the output file
  $packageRoot = ".\"
  $outputFile = "checksum.txt"

  # Remove the output file if it exists
  if (Test-Path $outputFile) {
      Remove-Item $outputFile
  }

  # Iterate through all files in the package, calculate their SHA-256 checksum, and save the result to the output file
  Get-ChildItem -Path $packageRoot -Recurse -File -Exclude ".git" |
  ForEach-Object {
      $hash = (Get-FileHash -Path $_.FullName -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
      Add-Content -Path $outputFile -Value "$hash *$($_.FullName)"
  }

  # Sort the output file by file path
  (Get-Content $outputFile) | Sort-Object | Set-Content $outputFile

  # Print the final checksum of the output file
  (Get-FileHash -Path $outputFile -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
  ```

  Save this script as `calculate_checksum.ps1` in any directory, and run it with `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\calculate_checksum.ps1 "C:\path\to\package_root"` providing the package root directory path as an argument. The output will be a file called `checksum.txt` containing the checksum of all files within the package, sorted by file path. The final checksum of the `checksum.txt` file will be printed to the console.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Publishing the checksum

In addition to including the `checksum.txt` file within the package uploaded to the tap repository, it is recommended that the checksum of the `checksum.txt` file be published on the release page, download page, or within the README. This enables users to calculate the package checksum, verify its consistency with the `checksum.txt` file in the package, and compare it to the published checksum.

Furthermore, ongoing discussions are aimed at developing a method for publishing the checksum on-chain, with the intention of enhancing the security and robustness of the process.
