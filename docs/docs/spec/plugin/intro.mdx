The plugin system provides a way to add new functionalities that are not included by default. This is necessary due to the diversity of services and structure that an AVS Node could have. Each AVS Node could provide a plugin to extend the setup tool with AVS-specific functionalities interacting with the services declared in the docker-compose setup.

## Plugin as a Docker image

A plugin is a Docker container created from a pre-built Docker image provided locally or in a Docker registry. 

The plugin **MUST** have the following requirement:

- The Docker image **MUST** have an [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint) that will be executed when the plugin is run.
- The Docker container **MUST** not expect input from the user. All the input **MUST** be provided as arguments in the `eigenlayer plugin` command. There is ongoing work to allow the plugin to interact with the user using stdin/stdout.

The plugin **SHOULD** have the following requirement:

- The Docker image **SHOULD** have a [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) that will be used as the default command when the plugin is run without arguments.
- The Plugin Docker image can share code with the AVS Node Docker image. In this case, the plugin Docker image **SHOULD** be different from the AVS Node Docker image. AVS developers **SHOULD** create and publish two different Docker images, one for the AVS and one for the Plugin.


## Running the plugin
Since it's a docker image, AVS can provide instructions for running those one time operations
```bash
docker run image:latest ...
```


## Accessing the AVS Nodes

The plugin container should be executed in the same docker network as the AVS Node instance by default. This means that the plugin container will be able to access the AVS Nodes, and it can use the Docker name resolution to access the services using the service names defined in the docker-compose file. It is the responsibility of the Developer to use proper service names and include all the necessary functionalities in the docker-compose file to allow the plugin to do all the actions properly.

Functionality to run the plugin container in the host network will be added as well.

## Plugin use cases:

-  **Custom setup**: The plugin could provide a custom setup for the AVS Node. For example, the AVS Node could provide a plugin to configure a custom database or service.
- **Admin tasks**: The plugin could interact with the AVS Node's admin module and perform admin tasks for the AVS Node. For example, the AVS Node could provide a plugin to backup the database, to restore it, or access it and run pruning on it.
- **Smart contract interaction**: The plugin could interact with EigenLayer smart contracts or the AVS protocol. For example, the AVS Node could provide a plugin to register a new AVS or to update the AVS.
- **Keystore processing**: The plugin could process the keystore files and perform actions with them. For example, the AVS Node could provide a plugin to import a keystore file.
- **AVS Node API interaction**: The plugin could interact with the AVS Node API. For example, the AVS Node could provide a plugin to get the AVS Node status.

The plugin can do a myriad of things, and it is up to the developer to decide what functionalities the plugin will provide. The plugin could be a simple script or a complex application. The plugin could be written in any language, and it is up to the developer to decide what language to use. The only requirement is that the plugin **MUST** be a Docker image that can be run as a container.

The plugin can even be a CLI application with a huge list of commands and have logic executed based on the response coming from the commands.
