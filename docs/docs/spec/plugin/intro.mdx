The plugin system will provide a way to extend the [AVS setup wizard tool](/docs/category/avs-setup-wizard) with new functionalities that are not included by default. This is necessary due to the diversity of services and structure that an AVS Node could have. Each AVS Node could provide a plugin to extend the setup tool with AVS-specific functionalities interacting with the services declared in the docker-compose setup.

## Plugin as a Docker image

A plugin is a Docker container created from a pre-built Docker image provided locally or in a Docker registry. 

## Declaring plugin source

The plugin source is declared in the [manifest file](/docs/spec/packaging/manifest#plugin) and could be overridden in the [profile file](/docs/spec/packaging/profiles#plugin_overrides) if necessary.

## Running the plugin

```bash
eigenlayer plugin [--avs [avs-name]] [plugin-name] [args...]
```

When the user runs the plugin, a container is created using the plugin image, and all the arguments specified by the user in the command are appended to the container [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint). The setup tool would run the container plugin instance and waits until it finishes, showing container logs. The exit code of the `eigenlayer plugin` command is the same exit code of the container plugin and will be printed in stdout to end-user knowledge.

The `--avs` flag could be used to specify target AVS. Will be required if multiple profiles of the same AVS Node are running. If only one profile runs, the tool will use it as the target.

## Accessing the AVS Nodes

The plugin container will be executed in the same docker network as the AVS Node instance by default. This means that the plugin container will be able to access the AVS Nodes, and it can use the Docker name resolution to access the services using the service names defined in the docker-compose file. It is the responsibility of the Developer to use proper service names and include all the necessary functionalities in the docker-compose file to allow the plugin to do all the actions properly.

Functionality to run the plugin container in the host network will be added as well.

## Plugin use cases:

-  **Custom setup**: The plugin could provide a custom setup for the AVS Node. For example, the AVS Node could provide a plugin to configure a custom database or service.
- **Admin tasks**: The plugin could interact with the AVS Node's admin module and perform admin tasks for the AVS Node. For example, the AVS Node could provide a plugin to backup the database or to restore it.
- **Smart contract interaction**: The plugin could interact with EigenLayer smart contracts or the AVS protocol. For example, the AVS Node could provide a plugin to register a new AVS or to update the AVS.
- **Keystore processing**: The plugin could process the keystore files and perform actions with them. For example, the AVS Node could provide a plugin to import a keystore file.
