Graft aims to help developers to create Grafana dashboards using [Library Panels](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/manage-library-panels/). Library Panels helps maintain the modularity of dashboards, and end users can build their own dashboards using these panels. With `graft` you could do these main actions:

- Initialize a development environment in Grafana (folders and datasources). See [Configuration](./config) for more information.
- Initialize dashboards and panels:
  - See [Init Dashboard](./dashboards#init-dashboard) section to know how to create a dashboard.
  - See [Init Panels](./panels#init-panel) to know how to initialize a panels.
- Backup panels and dashboards inside the generated environment.
  - See [Backup Panels](./panels#backup-panels) to know how to backup panels.
  - See [Backup Dashboards](./dashboards#backup-dashboards) to know how to backup dashboards.
