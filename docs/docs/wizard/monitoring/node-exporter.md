The [AVS setup wizard tool](/docs/category/avs-setup-wizard) would deploy the [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) instance as part of the [Monitoring Stack](/docs/wizard/monitoring/intro) to collect metrics from the host machine. To know more about how to visualize the Node Exporter metrics in Grafana, read the [Host Metrics](/docs/wizard/monitoring/grafana#host-metrics) dashboard documentation.
