[Grafana Dashboards](https://grafana.com/) is an open source solution for metrics visualization. In this case, Grafana is used to visualize metrics collected by the [Prometheus](/docs/wizard/monitoring/prometheus) instance from all the AVSs and the host machine.

The [AVS setup wizard tool](/docs/category/avs-setup-wizard) would deploy the Grafana instance with a set of initial resources. Each resource would have a unique `uid`. Initial resources would be the [EigenLayer folder](#eigen-layer-folder) and the [Host Metrics](#host-metrics) dashboard. Read more about them below.

:::note 

The `uid` is used to generate a unique URL for each resource, and it is unique across all resources in the Grafana instance. Be aware that the `uid` is not the same as the `id` property, which is auto-generated by Grafana. Also, some `uid` values would be reserved for the tool, and they couldn't be used for any other resource in the Grafana instance.

## EigenLayer folder

The AVS setup wizard tool creates the EigenLayer folder in Grafana. This folder is used to store all the dashboards for monitoring, both host and middlewares.

## Dashboards

Initially, the AVS setup wizard tool would deploy the following dashboards in the [EigenLayer folder](#eigen-layer-folder):

- **The [Host Metrics](#host-metrics) dashboard:** This dashboard monitors host resources like CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.
- **The Common Metrics dashboard**: This dashboard shows AVS data and graphs using the Prometheus metrics from the [Metrics Specification](/docs/spec/metrics/metrics-prom-spec) about a specific AVS instance. This dashboard is provided by the AVS setup wizard tool.
- **The Global Common Metrics dashboard**: This dashboard shows AVS data and graphs using the Prometheus metrics from the [Metrics Specification](/docs/spec/metrics/metrics-prom-spec) about all the AVS instances. This dashboard is provided by the AVS setup wizard tool.

The Node specific dashboards are provided by developers in the installation package. The tool would deploy them dynamically in the [EigenLayer folder](#eigen-layer-folder) when a new Node is deployed.

### Host Metrics

The Host Metrics dashboard show all the basic metrics of the host machine. This dashboard is very common in the Grafana community to monitor Linux hosts resources. This dashboard is built using the [Node Exporter](/docs/wizard/monitoring/node-exporter) metrics.

:::note
The `el-host-metrics` is a reserved `uid` for the **Host Metrics** dashboard and couldn't be used for any other dashboard in the Grafana instance.
