The [AVS setup wizard tool](/docs/category/avs-setup-wizard) would deploy the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) instance as part of the [Monitoring Stack](/docs/wizard/monitoring/intro) to collect metrics from the host machine and Nodes. Initially, the only target would be the [Node Exporter](/docs/wizard/monitoring/node-exporter), but Node targets could be added dynamically by the tool when a new Node is deployed.
